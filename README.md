# Tic-tac-toe
A Tic-tac-toe game 

## Description
This is a customizable Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. Players can choose the board dimension and specify how many marks in a row are needed to win. The game allows winning by horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines.

## Features
- Customizable board size (e.g., `3x3`, `4x4`, `5x5`, etc.).
- Adjustable win condition (e.g., `3 in a row`, `4 in a row`, etc.).
- Players take turns marking cells until there is a winner or the board is full.
- Win detection for **horizontal**, **vertical**, and **diagonal** alignments.

## How to Play
1. Run the Java program.
2. Enter the board dimension (e.g., `3` for a `3x3` board, `4` for a `4x4` board, etc.).
3. Enter the number of marks required in a row to win.
4. Players take turns placing their marks on the board.
5. The game announces the **winner** when a player meets the win condition or declares a **draw** if the board is full.
